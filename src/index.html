        <h1 class="head-title">Windows 13</h1>
        <p class="title">There will be no version of Windows 13 according to various sources of reports and data, but the Windows 13 concept is still widely available. The report revealed Microsoft had no intention of designing and developing another version of Windows. For now, if you think Microsoft might be working on Windows 13, you need to know it's impossible to do this work in silence. The development of any new operating system needs to be informed in advance by numerous government agencies and companies.</p>
        <p class="sub-title">Another report shows that Windows 10 will be Microsoft's most recent version of Windows. The argument for this statement is that Microsoft doesn't want to force people to buy new Windows altogether. The company will instead be working on the current version and improving it over time to meet the hardware requirements.</p>
